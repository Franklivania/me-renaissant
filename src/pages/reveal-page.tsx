            Born under a moon that refused to set, Niccol√≤ sings songs no one claims to
            have written ‚Äî yet all recall in dreams. His home is the hush between two trees.
            His words curl like smoke from cold tea. Once, he convinced a dying prince to laugh.
            Once, he made an owl cry. People do not remember his face, but they always recall
            their favourite line.

            revealed.
